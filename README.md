# Hangman Game

Hangman game is a simple guessing Python terminal game that player guess a number each time. There is a hint that tells the player if the number guessed is too big or too small from the target. The player keeps guessing until guesses a correct number or until reaches the maximum attempts allowed.

## Acknowledgement

* Whilst I have tried to deviate as much as possible, there might be some similarities in the code as the project was influenced by the code along Love Sandwiches project at [Code Institute]().

* I relied upon the support from Code Institue [online tutors](),  mentor [Precious Ijege](),  project lead [David Bowers](), Slack community and my families. Great thanks to all those who support my learning journey. 
  
* I use W3schools, YouTube and stack overflow for general references throughout the project. I watched the tutorial videos on Youtube to gain extra knowledge about Python.

* The [Hangman Game]() application is intended for education purpose of completing the Portfolio Project 3 for the Diploma of Full Stack Software Development course at [Code Institue](https://codeinstitute.net/).
